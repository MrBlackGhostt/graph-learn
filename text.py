The Legend of Colapesce
Long ago, in the city of Messina, Sicily, there lived a boy named Nicola, though everyone called him Colapesce—Cola the Fish. From the moment he could walk, he loved the sea. But more than love—it was as if the sea called to him.

He would dive deep for hours, swimming like a fish, exploring hidden caves, coral gardens, and shipwrecks lost to time. People said he had gills instead of lungs, and scales instead of skin. Some feared him, some admired him—but all agreed: he was not entirely human.

Word of Colapesce's gift spread, reaching the ears of Emperor Frederick II, a ruler known for his curiosity and wisdom. Intrigued, he traveled to the south to test this mysterious boy.

Standing on the deck of his royal ship, the Emperor called out:

“If you are truly part fish, dive for me! Bring me proof from the bottom of the sea.”

Colapesce smiled and dove—like a silver arrow slicing through the waves. Minutes passed. Then, he returned with a goblet from a sunken Roman ship.

The emperor was impressed—but not satisfied. He threw his golden crown into the sea.

“Bring this back, and I’ll believe your loyalty to the sea.”

Colapesce dove again. This time, he stayed below longer. When he rose, gasping but smiling, he held the crown in his hand.

But the Emperor, proud and demanding, threw down one final challenge. He took a piece of burning sulfur, the hottest thing he could find, and tossed it into the deepest part of the sea.

“If you are truly one with the ocean,” he said, “bring this back too.”

Colapesce hesitated—this was no ordinary object. Sulfur burned not just the skin, but the spirit. Still, he nodded and dove for the last time.

He never returned.

Days passed. Some said the sea claimed him. Others said the fire was too much, even for him. But in time, sailors began to tell a different tale:

Colapesce had not died. In his final dive, he discovered a terrible truth—that Sicily was built on three massive columns, and one of them was cracked, ready to collapse.

So he made a choice.

Colapesce stayed beneath the island, holding up the broken pillar with his own body, sacrificing himself to keep Sicily from sinking into the sea. Every now and then, people say the earth shakes—that’s just Colapesce shifting his weight, still holding strong.
